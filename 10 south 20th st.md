Sweetie and kyle cecil - 12/17 
     Used little giant ladder from lobby maintenance closet to take the faulty globe light apart and removed the old ballasts. Adam from main st realty came and dropped off 7 ballasts, leaving 3 extra. We left the 3 extra ballasts in the maintenance closet and installed the other 4 in the globe light and tested. Found that (6) 4 pin cfls(f26ddtt/de/841/g24q-3/eco) are burned out and need to be replaced ![[20241217_091220.jpg]]![[20241217_090231.jpg]]
